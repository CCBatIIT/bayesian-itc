Hi John,

Here's all my ITC data for titrating Magnesium Chloride into EDTA.
The file names are formatted with
Mg(number)EDTA(number)(label)(extension). The first number is the
Magnesium Chloride concentration in the syringe, in mM. The second
number is the EDTA concentration in the cell, in mM. The label starts
at 'a' and goes to 'j' for the final protocol. The extension is .inj
for the injection protocol, .itc for the raw data in MicroCal's
format, .OPJ for an Origin project, .DAT for the integrated heats,
RAW.DAT for the thermogram without baseline correction, and PDF for
the model fit to the integrated heat.

Do you want to take it from here?

David
