Titration of ddH2O into ddH2O, with reference cell filled with ddH2O.
The ddH2O (milliQ) was filtered again with 0.22 um filters prior to use.

PROTOCOL

An equilibration period of 3600 s, during which stirring and power measurement takes place, occured prior to first injection.
26 injections of 10 ul were carried out, with 20 s for the injection, and a spacing of 600 s between injection start times.
