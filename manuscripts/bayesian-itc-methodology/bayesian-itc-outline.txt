Bayesian ITC outline

== Introduction ==
 * ITC is a powerful tool for probing the thermodynamics of molecular interactions.
 * How ITC works.
 * Sources of error
 * Bayesian treatment of error can give full joint posterior
 
 * Designing experiments based on expected information content.  (Choose concentrations, volumes, etc.) (e.g. choose injection volume for competition assay given weak direct ITC curve)
 "The Bayesian framework presented here can also be used to aid in the design of subsequent experiments based on previously-collected experimental data or prior expectations."
